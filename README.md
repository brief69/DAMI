# DAMI (Under Development)

## DAMI is a still experimental new definition of the internet

- With auth_micro, authenticated users can use DAMI. Authentication will be possible with a passkey.

- p2p_micro ensures highly efficient p2p communication automatically for almost all data types, providing efficient p2p communication.

- gql_micro automatically generates and references GraphQL queries for data already present in the network through p2p_micro's DHT when users need it.

- gcn_micro processes almost all events in DAMI, including data transmission and reception, GraphQL queries, and p2p communication, through gnn. How this will be used is under consideration.
